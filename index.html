            This is a paragraph <br>
            It is going to be a chunk <br>
            But because I could use Text-Align Center <br>
            It doesn't seem like a block <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Another paragraph <br>
            just to have an example <br>
            because blocks can get strange <br>
        </p>
